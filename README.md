Backup container's volume
=========================

A docker container image for scheduling backup of the volume.

This container runs cron, and compress `/data/` directory to `/backup/` directory as a tar.xz file every day.

``` bash
$ docker run -d -v your-data:/data:ro -v $(pwd):/backup -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro ghcr.io/andyhan/volume-backup
```

In default, it runs backup on 2:42 every day, and retain 3 versions.
You can customize this behavior via environment variables.

Note: You can not stop this container with Ctrl-C. Please use `docker stop` command.
